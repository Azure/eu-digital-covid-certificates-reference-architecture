## Private Link

Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can also create your own Private Link Service in your virtual network and deliver it privately to your customers.

This Project utilises Private Link's security & privacy benefiting of eliminating exposure from the public Internet and opting into the whole infrastructure being inaccessible from the Internet, apart from a jump-box and ingress functionality.
