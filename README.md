# COVID 19 EU Digital Green Certificate Project

## Background
In early 2021 the European Union agreed to implement a system for member countries to issue and verify vaccination, testing and recovery certificates using a stndardized system. This is part of an initiative to homoginize travel/immigration policies among member countries. The system is made up of several components which have been shared in a sample implementation on a Github repo [here](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates).

## Project goals
As for other sample applications, PE COE intends to focus on data protection and privacy controls and showcase options and capabilities of Azure as the hosting cloud. The architecture choices will therefor be driven by the opportunity to showcase these features rather than scale/performance considerations.

## Data protection/data residency scenarios
