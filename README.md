# EU Digital Covid Certificate - Azure Reference Architecture

## Project purpose
The Azure platform offers some of the most extensive and advanced controls for protecting security and privacy of customer data.

The reference architecture in this repository is intended to showcase some of these controls making Azure a great choice for hosting mission critical workloads. As context for this exercise, rather than developing a fictitious workload, we will adopt a familiar (at least in the European Union), mission critical, distributed, and open-source workload. This choice will allow us to focus on the cloud deployment and configuration best practices, leveraging existing code for the workload itself.

## Introducing the "EU Digital Green Ceritificates" project
The "EU Digital Green Ceritificates" project (aka "EU Digital Covid Certificates" project, hereforth EU DCC), is intended to facilitate free movement of EU citizens in compliance to a common set of COVID regulations and allowing for some level of per-country customization. It was Developed by Deutsche Telekom and SAP and shared as open source for implementation and hosting by all EU member countries. The repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-overview).

## Documentation
